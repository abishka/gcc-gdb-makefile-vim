In git commit 3 : \

with editing makefile we can use \ 
- 'make' command to make and exec file going to build directory \
- 'make clean' command also cleaning files that make create at build dir 
- 'make run' runing executing c program  ...  
      
.vimrc  
i just  add 'set number' we can use it with copy to home dir ... like  'cp .vimrc ~'
